1.A lightning component should display a list of Account records which meets the following
criteria: Industry ="Financial Services" (Note: Add the “Financial Services” picklist value to
Industry field in the Account object). The heading of the component should read as ‘Financial
Services Account Listing’
2.The list should include the following information for each account record: Account Name,
Account Owner, Phone, Website, and Annual Revenue.
3.Ability to sort the data either by Account Name or Account Owner.
4.Ability to edit a record directly in the component if user has permission to edit that record.
5.Ability to navigate to the Account detail record page when user clicks the Account Name. The
record should be opened in a new tab.
